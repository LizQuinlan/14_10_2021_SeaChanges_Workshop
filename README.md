# 14_10_2021_SeaChanges_Workshop

Test repository created as part of the SeaChanges Workshop in Oslo 2021

I'm hoping to learn the following things during this workshop
1. More about creating and editing markdown files, committing changes, submutting pull requests and merging documents.
2. How I can incorporate GitHub into management of my code produced for my PhD
3. How to properly present my GitHub profile

My research is focused on Atlantic Salmon in the North Sea Basin, and I've been doing a lot of coding in R recently. I've got quite a lot of data visualization work done in R, for isotopic and archaeological data. I'm getting better at managing it within rStudio locally on my computer, but I know I should be making us of GitHub to properly document and share my work. I set up this GitHub profile almost a year ago but haven't added anything to it since. Time to fix that!

This workshop is being led by Esther Plomp, and its been a fantastic introduction so far!
